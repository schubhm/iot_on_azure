# Hydroficient Project

The Hydroficient project is an IoT solution designed to monitor and optimize water usage in agricultural settings. This repository contains the code and documentation for the integration of Hydroficient with Azure services.

## Overview

Hydroficient utilizes IoT devices such as sensors and actuators to collect data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and water usage in agricultural fields. This data is transmitted to Azure IoT Hub for processing and analysis. Leveraging Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning, Hydroficient provides actionable insights and recommendations to farmers for efficient water management.

## Features

- Collects real-time data from IoT sensors deployed in agricultural fields.
- Integrates with Azure IoT Hub for device management, telemetry ingestion, and command and control.
- Processes and analyzes data streams using Azure Stream Analytics for real-time insights.
- Utilizes Azure Functions for serverless event-driven computing, enabling custom logic and automation.
- Leverages Azure Machine Learning for predictive analytics and decision support.

## Getting Started

To deploy and run the Hydroficient project, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Azure IoT Hub**: Create an Azure IoT Hub instance to manage IoT devices and enable communication with Azure services.

2. **Deploy IoT Devices**: Deploy IoT sensors and actuators in your agricultural fields and configure them to connect to Azure IoT Hub.

3. **Configure Azure Services**: Set up Azure Stream Analytics jobs, Azure Functions, and any other required Azure services according to the project requirements.

4. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydroficient.git
    ```

5. **Build and Deploy Code**: Build and deploy the code to your Azure environment, ensuring proper configuration and integration with Azure services.

6. **Run and Monitor**: Run the Hydroficient system and monitor telemetry data, analytics results, and system performance using Azure portal dashboards and monitoring tools.
